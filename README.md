# 👕 FlopClothing

**FlopClothing** is a playful, indie t-shirt brand experiment — designed and developed as a full-stack project with modern web technologies. The idea? To create a smooth, responsive online store for a fictional or experimental clothing line.

This project helped me explore everything from frontend design to backend logic and payment integration.
